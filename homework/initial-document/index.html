		<h3>Peer Review:</h3>
		<p><b>Steven Peterson - </b> "First off I noticed that under your purpose statement you spelled activities wrong, I liked the word play of "Bear-Sona I found that pretty comical, in my personal opinion I would change the opening line for his demographics (it was a little confusing to say that he is older than 20 years, you can just say he is 49 years old, as well as you would change hold to held, I really enjoyed your sketches, I can tell you put a lot of work into the sketches and you put plenty of detail that I was able to envision the website in my head. Good job!"</p>
		<p><b>Jonathan Fritter - </b> Romina, 
     You did a great job with telling us what the web site is for and who it is intended for.  Freddy is cute in a creepy kind of way.  Your wire frames are laid out very well.   I only have one concern.  I noticed that you chose Rexburg as your target city.  If you look back at the assignment, Bro.Robertson gives us 3 cities we should use for our weather page. Look under weather data and go to the JSON section.  I just don't want you to get points marked off.  I'm saying this as a friend and group member who wants you to get the grade you deserve. You do great work.
